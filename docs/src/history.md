# History ðŸ“ˆ

The **history** is the main output from the `rolling` dispatch mode.

## Full history

The full history consists of separate histories for the infrastructure, and of each train. The format is:

* A list of *infrastructure / interlocking* events:
   * **Wait**: time passing
   * **Route**: status of a route, pending/active/released.
   * **Authority**: a signal's given movement authority: None or a length.
   * **Reserved**: the lock status (locked = true/false) for exclusive reservation of an infrastructure resource (switch or detection section)
   * **Occupied**: detection section's occupancy status (occupied = true/false)
   * **Position**: position of movable track element (switch left/right)
* A list of for each train containing the history of its dynamics:
   * **Wait**: time passing. This form is generally only used when the train is not in the *running* state, as time deltas when running are given in the *Move* item.
   * **Node**: front of train arrives at node
   * **Edge**: front of train begins traveling along edge from source node to target node, with a specified distance. The target node may be omitted when the train is exiting the model.
   * **Sight**: the train starts or stops receiving information from an infrastructure object 
   * **Move**: a time delta, a driver action (accelerate/brake/coast), a distance delta and the train's updated velocity.

An example of contents (the specifics of the formatting are likely to change):

## Simplified history

The simplified history is a list of trains' arrival times at nodes.
This output format is used for example by the verification mode to 
check whether timing constraints are satisfied.

Example:

```
t1 0 b1
t1 0 n1
t1 1.4142135623730951 n2
t1 1.4142135623730951 n3
t1 30 n4
t1 30 n5
```
