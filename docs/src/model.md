## Model

![Model](model_small.png "Model")

The input model for `rolling` consists of three main components:

 * The **[infrastructure](./dgraph.html) üåç** model contains the tracks, movable elements, and
   signalling and interlocking components which are needed to do a
   running time analysis of railway dispatching.
 * The **[interlocking](./routes.html) üîí** model describes the elementary routes that can
   be dispatched.
 * The **[dispatch](./dispatch.html) üëã** list contains times of train and route setting.

`rolling` uses these components together to calculate a 
**[history üìà](./history.html)** 
of events, which contains the state of the infrastructure at each point in time, and the dynamics of the trains as they move on the infrastructure.

Each of these are described in more detail in their respective sections.
