# Model

The input model for `rolling` consists of three main components:

 * The **infrastructure** model contains the tracks, movable elements, and
   signalling and interlocking components which are needed to do a
   running time analysis of railway dispatching.
 * The **interlocking** model describes the elementary routes that can
   be dispatched.
 * The **dispatch** list contains times of train and route setting.

Each of these are described in more detail in their respective sections.
