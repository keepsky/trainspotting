# Arna

Station converted from engineering project using [RailCOMPLETE](https://www.railcomplete.com/) software.
This example demonstrates conversion from railML 
for a single to double track junction with additional station tracks
including a pendulum train cul-de-sac.

Tracks, switches, signals and detectors are imported from railML, while 
routes are derived from signal and detector placement. This may or may not be 
equal to the actual routes in use on the station, but suffices for our 
demonstrations.
