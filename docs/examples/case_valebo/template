# Valebø

Station converted from Bane NOR's model of the Norweigan national rail network.
This example demonstrates conversion from railML on a simple two track station.
Tracks, switches, signals and detectors are imported from railML, while 
routes are derived from signal and detector placement. This may or may not be 
equal to the actual routes in use on the station, but suffices for our 
demonstrations.
