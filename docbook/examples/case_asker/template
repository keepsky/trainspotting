# Asker 

Station converted from Bane NOR's model of the Norweigan national rail network.
This example demonstrates conversion from railML 
for a double junction station, connecting one double track with two double tracks,
with additional station tracks.

Tracks, switches, signals and detectors are imported from railML, while 
routes are derived from signal and detector placement. This may or may not be 
equal to the actual routes in use on the station, but suffices for our 
demonstrations.
